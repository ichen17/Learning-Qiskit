# Hello Quantum world
Here, I use Qskit to demostrate how to write the quantum circuit. Initially, all qubits will be set up 0 state. After adding  Hadamard gate, we can get the qubit zero with the superposition 0 and 1. By applying CNot gate on qubit 1 (targaet qubit) and qubit 0 (control qubit), we can get Bell state.
